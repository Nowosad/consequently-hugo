I'm giving a presentation on proof theory, modality, existence and verbal disputes at a workshop held at the University of Oxford in May, 2015.

I will attempt to be precise about the notion of a *merely verbal disagreement*, and explain how we can fix on the meaning of our logical constants can play a coordinating role in dialogue, and how (in a certain sense), it might be *impossible* to a have a merely verbal dispute concerning logical constants such as conjunction, negation, the quantifiers, and even---if you're *really* careful---modal operators.

Here is the [website for the workshop](https://verbaldisputesoxford.wordpress.com).
