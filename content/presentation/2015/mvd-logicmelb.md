This is a dry run for my [Oxford Talk](http://consequently.org/presentation/2015/verbal-disputes-oxford/). 

I will attempt to be precise about the notion of a *merely verbal disagreement*, and explain how we can fix on the meaning of our logical constants can play a coordinating role in dialogue, and how (in a certain sense), it might be impossible to a have a merely verbal dispute concerning logical constants such as conjunction, negation, the quantifiers, and even modal operators.

If you want to attend, keep track [on the PhilEvents entry for the talk](http://philevents.org/event/show/17569).
