I'm giving a talk entitled “What Proofs are About” at the [About Aboutness Workshop](http://philevents.org/event/show/24086) at the University of Melbourne on Saturday, July 16, 2016. 

*Abstract*: The talk is a comparison of how three different approaches to subject matter treat some simple propositional equivalences. I compare and contrast the notion of subject matter introduced in Stephen Yablo's *Aboutness* (Princeton University Press, 2014), truthmakers conceived of as situations, as discussed in my ``[Truthmakers, Entailment and Necessity](http://consequently.org/writing/ten/),'' and the *proof invariants* I have been exploring [in recent work](https://consequently.org/presentation/2016/terms-for-classical-sequents-aal-2016/).
