**<span class="caps">PHIL30043</span>: The Power and Limits of Logic** is a [University of Melbourne](http://unimelb.edu.au) undergraduate subject. It covers the metatheory of classical first order predicate logic, beginning at the *Soundness* and *Completeness* Theorems (proved not once but *twice*, first for a tableaux proof system for predicate logic, then a Hilbert proof system), through the *Deduction Theorem*, *Compactness*, *Cantor&rsquo;s Theorem*, the *Downward L&ouml;wenheim&ndash;Skolem Theorem*, *Recursive Functions*, *Register Machines*, *Representability* and ending up at *G&ouml;del&rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorems* and *L&ouml;b&rsquo;s Theorem*.

The sunject is taught to University of Melbourne undergraduate students (for Arts students as a part of the Philosophy major, for non-Arts students, as a breadth subject). Details for enrolment are [here](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/view/2015/PHIL30043). I make use of video lectures I have made [freely available on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/album/2262409).
