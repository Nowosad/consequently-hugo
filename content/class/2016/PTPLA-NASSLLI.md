[Shawn Standefer](http://www.standefer.net) and I will teach an intensive class on logical and philosophical issues in Proof Theory at [<span class="caps">nasslli</span> 2016](http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/nasslli2016). We'll be covering cut elimination, some substructural logics, and hypersequents, with a bit of inferentialism and bilateralism mixed in. 

* **Day 1**: *[Foundations](http://consequently.org/slides/nassli2016-pt-lpa-1-foundations.pdf)*. An introduction to the sequent calculus for intuitionistic and classical logic, cut elimination and some of its consequences. 
* **Day 2**: *[Substructural Logics](http://consequently.org/slides/nassli2016-pt-lpa-2-substructural-logics.pdf)*. Structural rules in sequent systems; the case of distribution; different substructural logics and their applications; revisiting cut elimination in substructural logics.
* **Day 3**: *[Beyond Sequents](http://consequently.org/slides/nassli2016-pt-lpa-3-beyond-sequents.pdf)*. Sequent sytstems for basic modal logics; three ways to move beyond traditional sequent systems---display logic, labelled sequents and tree hypersequents. 
* **Day 4**: *[Hypersequents for S5, Actuality and 2D Modal Logics](http://consequently.org/slides/nassli2016-pt-lpa-4-hypersequents-for-modal-logics.pdf)*. From tree hypersequents to simple hypersequents for S5; extending simple hypersequents to model actuality and two-dimensional modal logic.
* **Day 5**: *[Semantics](http://consequently.org/slides/nassli2016-pt-lpa-5-semantics.pdf)*. Normative pragmatics; the scope of rules and definitions; between proofs and models; moving beyond propositional logics.
